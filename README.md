**Features:**
- Developed with Java 17.
- Utilizes OpenCV 4.5.5.
- Performs human detection using the HOG algorithm.
- Captures and frames detected humans from a live camera feed.
- Explained in a beginner-friendly manner with a [blog post](https://tunadag.wordpress.com/2023/10/05/java-ile-goruntu-isleme-opencvde-hog-yontemiyle-nesne-tanimlama/) and detailed comments.
